Analysis of 1990s Netflix Movies

This analysis focuses on movies released during the 1990s available in the Netflix dataset. After filtering the dataset for entries categorized as Movies and released between 1990 and 1999, the duration field was cleaned and converted into numeric values to enable statistical and visual analysis. The primary objective was to understand patterns in movie duration, genre-based variations, and potential relationships between the year of release and runtime.

Three visualizations were generated to explore these insights:

Scatter Plot — Duration vs. Release Year:
This plot illustrates how movie durations varied across the 1990s. The points show no strong upward or downward trend, suggesting that film lengths remained relatively stable during the decade, with most runtimes clustering between 80–120 minutes.

Violin Plot — Duration Distribution by Genre:
The violin plot highlights how movie duration differs across genres. Action and Drama movies show wider distributions, indicating greater variation in runtime, while Comedy and Romance genres generally exhibit tighter ranges around shorter durations.

Correlation Heatmap — Release Year vs. Duration:
The heatmap quantitatively measures the relationship between release year and duration. The near-zero correlation coefficient confirms that the year of release in the 1990s had little to no influence on the length of movies.

In summary, the findings suggest that while certain genres tended to have longer or shorter films, there was no significant time-based trend in movie durations during the 1990s. This analysis demonstrates the use of data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights from real-world media data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
